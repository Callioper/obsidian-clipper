# Obsidian Chrome Clipper

This is an unofficial Chrome Extension to quickly clip a selection on a webpage to Obsidian.

## Installing

Since this extension is not yet published, a manual install is required. For this you will need to do the following:

1.  Download/clone this repository
2.  Navigate to the [Chrome Extension](chrome://extensions) and enabled developer mode (top right of your window)
3.  Load unpacked extension and navigate to the folder of this repository you just downloaded or cloned.
4.  Chrome will now build the extension and you can use the extension menu to pin in to the user interface.
5.  You're now ready to configure the extension, see the steps below:

## Usage & Settings

1.  Right-click on the extension icon in the menu, and click on options.
2.  A webpage should open where you can configure the options for this extension

## Building further upon this extension

Since Chrome allows you to set a custom shortcut to activate an extenion it should be pretty easy to chain it together with Keyboard Meastro or any other automation technology to both clip & paste the results.

## Roadmap

-   Once the url-scheme of Obsidian allows the creation of a new note, clip to a new note.
-   In the long term future, maybe even offer the possiblity to search through your notes and append it?
